Working with Bubble Sort and Select Sort

This project features implementations of Bubble Sort and Select Sort that track 
individual indices in an array of structs. These indice structs contain the 
the integer of a given array, as well as the amount of times that integer has been 
swapped during one of the mentioned sorting algorithms.
